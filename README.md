## Description

This repository contains a simple template for building [pdf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) document from a [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) project template. The template is from [Springer](https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/book-authors-editors/your-publication-journey/manuscript-preparation)

### Installing the Required LaTeX stuff

Please, check [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) homepage for extensive information. On macOS, it
can be installed as the [mactex](https://www.tug.org/mactex/) package using the [brew](https://brew.sh/) package manager and sit tight since the package is pretty big(around 4.6 GB):

```sh
brew install mactex
```
