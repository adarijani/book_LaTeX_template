In preparing this version in English of Fourier's celebrated treatise on Heat, the translator has followed
faithfully the French original. He has, however, appended brief foot-notes, in which will be found references 
to other writings of Fourier and modern authors on the subject : these are distinguished by the initials A. F.
 The notes marked R. L. E. are taken from pencil memoranda on the margin of a copy of the work that formerly 
 belonged to the late Robert Leslie Ellis, Fellow of Trinity College, and is now in the possession of St John's
  College. It was the translator's hope to have been able to prefix to this treatise a Memoir of Fourier's 
  life with some account of his writings; unforeseen circumstances have however prevented its completion in 
  time to appear with the present work.
